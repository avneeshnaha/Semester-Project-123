Improvements:
-	Improve security protocols and validation of user input. The automated backdrop picture switching was a nice feature.
-	Setting password validation, such as requiring seven characters or more, would be beneficial.
-	Making it clearer to users how to utilise this website should be an improvement.
-	To inform users of what they're logging into, provide a logo or programme name on the home page and log-in page.
-	Font size is inconsistent. 
-	Texts and the banner can be enhanced for a more professional look.  





















Plan:

Re-watch the Laracast videos to get a further understanding on how to fix the PHP code. Also, it would be beneficial for me to take notes from the DGL-103 class on HTML and CSS and implement some more refined design techniques onto my project.
